----------
Plugin manager now sends the messages to the plugins correctly. I still want to get each plugin in its own thread, but that will be later. The plugin format works, and adding new features will be really easy. 

Stuff I want to do:
- Prevent plugins from having conflicting command words, like "/name". Only one plugin may have a certain command word for all plugins. 
- Make plugins run in their own thread (they might already be, I honestly haven't bothered to check)
- Add plugin for turning chat in anonymous name only mode
- Add Kick plugin and Ban plugin
